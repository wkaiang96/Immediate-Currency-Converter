###### This plugin required jquery to works. The jquery version I'm using is 3.2.1 (non-minified version). 

###### The jquery file has been included in the extension, in case you would to reproduce it, copy the whole jquery-3.2.1 and make a new file again.

###### The currency rate that I'm getting is from https://www.fixer.io. Visit their site to know about it.
